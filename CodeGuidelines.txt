# Code guidelines
# Projects should be build using CMake and work on Linux 14.04 LTS (or maybe 12.04 or 16.04, need to decide).  Put any configuration steps
in this file in this file: 
# example:
  sudo apt-get intstall ROS


# Style Guide
 We attempt to follow the Google C++ style guide if possible.https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html to improve the consistency 
 of the code.  Reasonable diversions from this guide are fine but should discussed.
